**How ProSolve Works**
[User] 
   ↓ enters scenario
[Frontend App.js]
   ↓ builds text + payload
[API /simulate]
   ↓ calls LLM (Groq)
[LLM JSON Output]
   ↓ Scores + Risks + Metrics
[FastAPI Backend]
   ↓ Saves to SQLite
[Frontend]
   ↓ Renders scenario card
   ↓ Updates Today’s Work

The LLM request includes:

  System prompt template
  Scenario text
  Context object
  Required JSON schema
  Backend guarantees:
  Always returns structured JSON
  Automatically logs errors
  Mock fallback enabled
